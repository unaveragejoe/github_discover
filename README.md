# GitHub Discover
An analysis and webapp + recommendation system for similar repos.

Purpose: It's easy to find things on GitHub if you know what you're looking for, but there isn't really a great recommendation system for finding similar repos to yours, or similar users for that matter. The idea of this project was to prototype that idea.

There are a few components of this project:
- Scraping data from Github using the PyGitHub API
    - repo readmes, commits, user profiles, and more
- Developed content based recommendation algorithm to surface similar repos based on repo descriptions
- Developed a web app using React-js to prototype the app

Note: Need to add the web app
